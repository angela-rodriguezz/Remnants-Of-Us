 ## Gameplay

 I was involved in the development of all in-game mechanics. For instance, I programmed for the animations, movement, dialogue, and platform interation with the main character.

 The character switches between idle, jumping, and collection phases within the gameplay. The player doesn't know the location of the object in question and must search through the vertical platform map in order to find the object -> a bunny from their childhood.

 Each object alludes to a dreamlike fantasy within the environment. The player is not aware they're in the afterlife until the interation with the spirit at the bottommost level of the map.
